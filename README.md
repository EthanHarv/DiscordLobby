# DISCORDLOBBY

DiscordLobby (GameLobby) is a member-oriented system for managing and creating dynamic and customizable channels within a server. 

This bot was created back when I was in 8th grade, and development on it has completely stopped, and will not resume. I still host a version of it for public use (see below), but any bugs/issues that arise may take awhile to get fixed or never get fixed.
